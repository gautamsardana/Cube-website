# Cube-website
Website which provides algorithms for solving a cube along a timer

Software requirements:
1.	Editor (notepad).
2.	Web browser (chrome/firefox)
3.	Wampserver

Recent technologies used:
1.	Bootstrap 4.1.0
2.	jQuery 3.3.1

Solution to existing problems:
1.	Existing cubing websites provide algorithms and tutorials only for beginner cubers. None of the most popular websites help the professional cubers who are aiming to get their average timings less than 10 seconds. My website provides algorithms to such kind of people. The algorithms mentioned in the website are used by world champions themselves.
2.	A lot of cubers record their timing on their android device and use timer applications to do that. My website provides algorithms as well as a timer which displays their average timings so no need of an additional application on their device. 


Steps to run the website:
1.	Install wampserver so that we can run the php file since php is a server side language.
2.	Put all the given files inside c://wamp64/www/
3.	Run wampserver.
4.	Open a web browser.
5.	Type the url in the address bar as “Localhost/index.html” without the quotes.
6.	The website runs.
7.	Enter userid as “Gautam” and Password as “admin” without the quotes and the home page will appear.
